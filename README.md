title: "who am i?" personality quiz

this was the second project that i completed for the girls who code program in the web development track! it's a personality quiz using HTML, CSS, and javascript.
the requirements were to create three questions, each with two answers. these answers had to correlate to a result and after each question was answered, the user would be given one of the results.
i've always loved personality quizzes, so i decided to do more than the required amount of questions, answers, and results. i based my personality quiz on personality quizzes that i used to take in middle school on uquiz.com! i think it's really fun and creative to make a deeper personality quiz, especially because i can match the aesthetic of the website to mood of the questions.
this quiz asks the user a question: "who am i?" and decides whether the user is the butterfly, the eye, the book, the tree, or the cat based on a set of 10 questions each with 5 answers!

what i struggled with: i had an issue in javascript when i wanted to update the person's results. for some reason, it wouldn't change the result text when the user clicked "restart". i struggled with this for a while before i realized i made a spelling error and i missed it even though i kept looking over it!
what i learned: i learned that i needed to be meticulous when debugging to spot any spelling errors because they can mess up the whole program. i also learned that i should be creative when programming, even when it's a simple project!
